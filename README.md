Open-Ended Experiment 1: Visual Insights from Real-World Data
Title: Discover Patterns and Trends from Real-World Data Using Python Visualization Libraries

Objective:
Students will select a real-world dataset (from Kaggle, UCI, or any open-source platform) and explore it using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to uncover hidden trends, anomalies, or insights.

Task:

Choose a dataset relevant to a theme (healthcare, environment, finance, sports, etc.).

Formulate 2â€“3 interesting questions or hypotheses.

Use appropriate visualizations (scatter plots, heatmaps, line charts, etc.) to answer the questions.

Justify why each visualization was used and interpret the results.

Add interactivity if applicable (for Plotly users).

Expected Outcome:
Students will submit a Jupyter notebook containing:

Data cleaning (brief)

Visualizations with explanations

Inference or conclusion

Skills Developed:

Data analysis, tool selection, storytelling through visuals, real-world relevance.

Open-Ended Experiment 3: Designing a Business Intelligence Dashboard
Title: Create a Business Intelligence Dashboard for Decision-Making Using Power BI or Tableau

Objective:
Students will simulate a real-world scenario where a business (e.g., retail store, e-commerce platform, airline, or education institution) needs a dashboard to make strategic decisions based on data.

Task:

Select or create a multi-sheet dataset (e.g., sales data, customer reviews, performance metrics).

Define at least 3 key business questions (e.g., "Which region has the lowest sales?", "What time period shows performance drops?").

Use Power BI or Tableau to build an interactive dashboard with filters, slicers, and drill-down features.

Justify visual choices and explain how a stakeholder would use it.

Expected Outcome:
An interactive BI dashboard demonstrating:

Effective data visualization

Real-world application

User interactivity and navigation

Skills Developed:

Business thinking, KPI visualization, interactivity, decision-support system creation
